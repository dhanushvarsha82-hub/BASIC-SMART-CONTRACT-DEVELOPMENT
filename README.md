For this internship task, I was asked to create something called a smart contract, which is basically a small computer program that runs on the blockchain. The goal of the assignment was to develop a very simple token system where tokens can be created and transferred from one person to another, similar to how digital money works. Even though the concept of blockchain sounds complicated, this task was designed to help me understand the basics in a simple and practical way.

The first step in the task was to write the smart contract using a programming language called Solidity. Solidity is used to build applications on the Ethereum blockchain. In this project, I had to write a contract named SimpleToken that behaves like a very basic cryptocurrency. The contract needed to store the name of the token, its symbol, how many decimal places it has, and the total number of tokens that exist. More importantly, it had to keep track of how many tokens each user owns.

After setting up these basic details, the next important part of the task was allowing tokens to be transferred between different people. For this, I had to include a function inside the contract called transfer. This function checks whether the person sending the tokens actually has enough balance. If they do, the tokens are reduced from their account and added to the receiver’s account. This simple action represents how digital transactions happen on the blockchain without any bank or middleman. The contract itself acts like a judge and ensures that rules are followed.

To complete the task, I also had to deploy the smart contract on a blockchain environment. Instead of using real money, we use test networks like the Remix JavaScript VM or testnet ETH so that we can experiment safely. Deploying the contract basically means uploading it to the blockchain so that it becomes active and can be interacted with. Once the contract is deployed, I can call its functions, check my token balance, and try transferring tokens to another address.

This task also helped me understand how transparent and secure blockchain systems are. Every transaction, balance update, and rule execution is recorded automatically. Nothing can be changed from behind the scenes. Whatever rules I wrote inside the smart contract cannot be broken once deployed. This teaches an important lesson: writing smart contracts requires careful thought because once they go live, they cannot be edited easily.

Throughout this task, I gained a much clearer understanding of how cryptocurrencies work at a basic level. Even though this token system was simple, the same ideas are used in real-world applications like Ethereum, USDT, NFTs, and many decentralized apps. Learning how to write, deploy, and test a smart contract gives a strong foundation for more advanced blockchain development in the future.
